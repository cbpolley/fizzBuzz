# fizzBuzz
The fizzBuzz task with dynamic words and multipliers

Task

Create the fizzBuzz program in Javascript, but allow the user to interact with the program. The user is able to change the words fizz or buzz to a set of pre-programmed words, and the user can also change the multiplication values (i.e. 3 or 5) to any other whole number. The user must also specify a number of iterations for the fizzBuzz program to cycle through.
